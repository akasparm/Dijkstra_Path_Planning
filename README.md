# How to run the code:
Dijkstra Algorithm for path planning

## 1. Required Libraries: numpy, cv2, math, time, queue

## 2. Input: 
The code asks for user input for initial and destination (x, y) coordinates.
If the given coordinates intersect with obstacle or walls, user will be asked to input until the valid coordinates are provided.

## 3. Output:
The code generates image frames that shows the exploration of the node and shortest path to reach the goal.
A video file will be generated and saved for the same animation.
